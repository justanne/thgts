Finally, after crazy dragging my butt out of the bed every early dawn in the morning and a result of palpitating arteries courtesy of a strong coffee, introducing, a **Jekyll**-powered journal!

[Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com), is a static site generator built with Ruby. Usually popular among blogger developers who wants blogging simple and fully customizable (read: control) blog. [And that is the reason why it was built](//tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). 

It was fairly easy to use. Just save my markdown post on a directory, push it on Github, and there ya go, live. Jekyll isn't new at all, and been lying around the internet for years, but finally got my hands on it.

### Moving from paid shared-hosting server to free open-source host

#### Point #1
I don't mind sharing my code to the world, I owe it to the internet where I self-learned web development, and everything can be googled. Besides, I got a bonus: a versioning feature. In case I lost a copy in my local or got tangled in a buggy stage of the site, I could just clone the repo from Github and there goes an instant time machine. Well, I suppose a lot of designers and all developers already knew that. Just saying though.

#### Point #2
Almost everything now can be cracked in the internet: software, apps, consoles, gadgets, etc. If its a paid item, one person could just buy it and make it available free to everyone. And its no exception when it comes to codes, they can be exposed one way or another, get ripped, and you'll just be shocked to see your website get cloned by another individual, agencies, or even companies. So what's the point in hiding those codes? Well I understand companies that has large branches of sites and codes that are highly valued, it is indeed a must to keep it safe from attacks and suchâ€¦ but erm, unless you are one of those companies, what's keeping you from sharing it?
