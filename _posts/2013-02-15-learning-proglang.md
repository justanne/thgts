For two days I've able to do 2 milestones. The other day I've created a Ruby plugin for Jekyll using Bit.ly API. Nothing much about the [code](https://github.com/justanne/thgts/blob/src/_plugins/shorten.rb), I've actually searched for an existing Bitly plugin that I can use but those I've downloaded doesn't work for me. The plugin I just did creates a shortlink on the permalinks that Jekyll generates. 

And yesterday I've successfully deployed a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) app built with a deadly snake, Python. Though its not (yet) a full-pledged app ready to be used by millions, I'll be charged of my usage if it accumulates traffic and I'll go bankrupt. It is rather more of a test app. I designed a Coming Soon page, coded it to HTML and used [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) framework with it. Then I've deployed it to Heroku.

Its just a simple hard-coded coming soon page at the moment, but of course, this wouldn't stop here. I have yet to make it dynamic and step-by-step work with the features. Just the beginning of more challengesâ€¦ and a lot more action in the command line (CLI). Weird that I do like working with CLI rather than a GUI.

In sum, for days I've dealt with the following:

- Ruby<br>
Jekyll (static page generator)<br>
Liquid (templating)

- Python <br>
Flask (static page generator)<br>
Jinja2 (templating)

- API (Bit.ly) via Ruby

- Foreman

- Virtualenv

- Werkzeug

- Heroku

..and a spaghetti code brain of mine.
