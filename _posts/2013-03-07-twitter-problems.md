Every platform has its own dark sides. Or perhaps I can say it depends on how community uses it.

Going straight to the point. I hate how bots and spams are invading the twitter-sphere. It's annoying, and as often as I use my account, it totally drives me out. I hate how they market their products, luring you to click their links, just to have that "temporary" traffic. 

When I was still new in Twitter, I encountered a weird profile starts following me and mentions me out of the blue with the keywords of their product. Then another profile comes in following, looks human but awkwardly indecent (we're all adults but hey, let's keep it all to ourselves and real-world lives).

Another encounter is when a friend's account DMs something she didn't do herself. It's actually a DM to me, and suspiciously I know she doesn't talk like that. Hacked and spammed, they win. Of course its been sorted out by changing her password to a more secure one.

Finally, the followers who expects you to follow them back. I've got no problem returning the favor, what bothers me are the ones who unfollow you after you follow them back. Wise, eh?

Though, honestly, I'm not caring that much on how many followers I should get, what matters to me is I'm updated with ideas, opinions, and fun things from interesting people I follow. Besides, twitter themselves have said it: 

> "Find out what's happening, right now, with the people and organizations you care about".
