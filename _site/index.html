  <p>Upset with something from someone in the internet? Get up, go out, play with your dog, cuddle with a cat, start small talks with others. Then go back to your table and think clear. Reply with a mature and appropriate attitude. Now that's negative force turns into positive. It does work. :)</p>

<p>First reactions usually on flaming discussions and debates is you'll outrageously type fast in defense of yourself or in offense of the others.</p>

<p>Type offensive statement. Enter. Days passed, in a cool mood, and revisited the thread. <em>"Omg, did I really wrote that?"</em>. Regrets.</p>

<p>It happens everywhere in the internet: comments, forums, twitter and facebook status. Sadly it looks foolish and immature.</p>

<p>Maybe try to divert your mind first off that comment and when you go back, re-read in a calm manner. If you feel less upset, then its try to compose a well thought out reply.</p>

<p>But we have to keep in our minds one thing when handling such type of discussions - don't expect people to just bend to our opinions. Even though we can prove we are correct and they are wrong, they've got pride and they chose to stick what they have grown to believe. If they do say <em>"Ah yes, indeed"</em>, then its just the bonus.</p>

<p>Simply lay the cards on the table and leave it up to them whether to absorb or reject it. You've got other audience as well who will chose to understand your side.</p>

<p>Of course, this wouldn't apply on trolls. Just ignore them. They're just attention seekers with a boring life.</p>

<h1>Feeling argumentative?</h1>

<hr />

<p>The following is something that stuck in my mind since I was young. I picked up the lessons from the book of Dale Carnegie that I read that time.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>"If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically."</strong> - No such thing as degradation of yourself if you are admitting you are wrong, actually, others would admire you for doing so. Because this shows you are capable of accepting changes. Narrow minded people would chuckle at you, but who cares with them?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You can't win an argument.</strong> - Yeah, Dale Carnegie is right. Even if you proved you are right, deep down inside the other person, is resentment. So you are not really winning. They'll just stick to what they believe and do after all the ramblings. This is from another perspective from above statement, but let's face it, not all people are capable of admitting their mistakes. I see many people find it hard to admit their wrong. As I've said above, just lay the cards and eventually, without verbally confirmation, they'll just realize, "Yeah, this person got a point".</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Go grab the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a>. It is vital as well to entrepreneurs, and business owners that handles people. Dale C. has cool real-life examples that you'll definitely learn something.</p>

<p>This is the version I've read years ago: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OzTj22y.jpg">Book</a></p>
