My Thoughtbook
================
[http://thgts.annebarrios.me](http://thgts.annebarrios.me)

Not a fan of the overused word *"blog"*, I'm putting my thoughts on it, collectively, so I'm calling it a **Thoughtbook**. Purely thoughts, ideas, opinions, and perhaps tips/tricks that I learn as I sail by on the web development world.

Will be built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
Hosted here. Open to everyone.
