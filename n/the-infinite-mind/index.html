	<p>Have you heard of <strong>The Oatmeal</strong><sup>1</sup>? Its one of my favorite online comics. It resonates real world things in a funny, vulgar way.</p>

<p>There is one particular <em>lengthy</em> comic that I strongly agree with.</p>

<p>To start with, the author of the comic is a content writer (based and stated in his comic), and his message doesn't only applies to content writers, but obviously to all careers that are related to creativity and art: designers, illustrators, graphic artists, yes - writers, novelists, journalists, etc. and web is just one of the industries (web/designers, fashion/designers, interior/designers). Down to the topic - <strong>creativity mind pool</strong><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>This is all about, why <strong>real</strong> creativity doesn't just happens everyday, or otherwise we are just sucked up dry. Designers have <em>creativity block</em>, writers have <em>writer's block</em>. It is true, and most will agree, the best ideas are popped up in the middle of something, away from the desk. Simply say, its while you are experiencing life, hiking on mountain or sailing in the middle of the sea.</p>

<p>Reiterating Matthew Inman: <em>"if you don't have anything to write about, <strong>don't write</strong>"</em>. And we had the same view, sometimes I haven't updated my blog because there aren't something new worth sharing or informative. We are looking at a quality, rather than the quantity. Wouldn't you like to anticipate the next storyline as interesting, rather being updated regularly but the story is getting boring and repititiveâ€¦? Now you know, why comic book and manga releases once a month, and you can't just wait for next month to come! <em>(I'm a manga fan, and a "The Walking Dead" reader)</em></p>

<p><strong>The comments.</strong> I just have to agree, though comments enables a community, the way I see it, is just leaning more to a nuisance. You can just see it from the comic above. So to preserve sanity and happy life, I'd rather not have comments enabled.</p>

<p>In summary, we do all have our own reasons why we are doing such things; and must understand to those who wants to demand something from us and we can't cut it - we are just humans... we need to breathe and take a break once in a while.</p>
